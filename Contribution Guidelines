We welcome contributions from the community! Follow the steps below to contribute:

Step-by-Step Contribution Process:
1. Create a New Branch
Always create a new branch to make your changes. It helps to keep the main codebase stable.

Create a new branch with a descriptive name:
  git checkout -b feature-branch-name

2. Make Your Changes
Make the necessary changes in your branch, whether it's fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation.

3. Commit Your Changes
Once your changes are ready, add them to Git:

  git add .
Write a clear, concise commit message:

  git commit -m "Description of the change"

4. Push Your Changes
Push your changes to your forked repository:
  git push origin feature-branch-name

5. Create a Pull Request
Go to your GitHub repository.
You should see a button to Compare & pull request.
Click it, and write a description of the changes you’ve made.
Submit your pull request for review.

6. Wait for Review
One of the project maintainers will review your pull request. They may request changes or approve and merge it.
Guidelines:
Code Style: Follow the coding style outlined in the repository. This could include linting rules or formatting styles (e.g., Prettier, ESLint).
Commit Messages: Use descriptive commit messages that explain what the change does.
Issue Tracking: If there’s an issue tracker, link your pull request to any open issues it fixes. Example: Fixes #42.
